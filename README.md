# PPG_Clustering
tries to cluster ppg signals<br> 
**LDA and Autoencoder.ipynb** <br>	this notebook cluster peak to peak ppg signals using LDA and fully connected autoencoder as features extractor<br>
**general_pca_kmeans_notebook.ipynb** <br> this notebook cluster complete signals of ppg using PCA [2 PCA components]as a features reduction technique [no plots of signals and results was not satisfied]<br>
**heart_rate_equqlization.py**<br> this notebook contain functions able to divide PPG signal to peak to peak parts and then normalize each on beat to equal number of time steps
